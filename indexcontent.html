		<b>Current Progress: </b>During week 11 and 12 we have been reading data packets sent from our controller's IC and sender breakout
		board. You can find some of the examples  below:

		<b>Financial Status: </b> No new items were purchased. However, acquiring Raspberry Pi 3 is now considered as an unnecessary
		purchase. Budget will be updated.<br>
		<b>Probems and Opportunities: </b> We stritcly follow project's deadlines and have no late submissions (milestones) so far. However, we have encountered
		a problem with singals. We have not found any documentation on our quadcopter's transceiver, therefore connectivity 
		between hardware components and the drone might be not established. <br>

		<ul> Progress Report
			<li>On November 12 we had Open House Event at North Campus where we had to present our project. Our goal was to 
				establish connection between 2 Nordic semiconductors (SparkFun nRf2401+ breakout boards) and display 
				it on Ardunino's serial monitor. We have successfully established the connection and received some feedback.
				Also, we added a feature of LED communication through the code. In other words, When the connection between 2
				boards was established (delay 5 seconds), LED of sender goes green. Otherwise, if connection fails out, the 
				LED goes red. LED of the receiver is always green because it is indicating that the board is always trying to 
				receive a signal.<br><br>
				
				This is Q/A from Open House:<br><br>
				<b>Q:</b> Is everything built from scratch and how did you assemble it?<br>
				<b>A:</b> Drone package included the quadcopter and controller already. We had to build 
				the rest ourselves.<br><br>
					
				<b>Q:</b> Which type of connection is going between 2 boards?<br>
				<b>A:</b> SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). It is serial communication interface used to communicate in 
				short distances.<br><br>
				
				<b>Q:</b> What will be the final state of the project?<br>
				<b>A:</b> Full control on the drone by the software (Android Application).<br><br>
				</li>
				<li> 	Right now we are analyzing packets that are getting send to oscilloscope when we push different buttons
					on the controller. Controller's PCB has embedded transceiver IC which is problematic because we were expecting
					to use IC separately from the controller's PCB.
				</li>

	<ul>Progress Report.
		<li>
			No new parts acquired (budget was not increased).
		</li>
		<li>
			No parts were damaged during the whole process of the project (assembly, power up)
		</li>

		 <b>Update: </b>Drone controller has mx297 transceiver on which I have not found any information online. Problem is to connect to antenna 
		 of the controller using sparkFun breakout board.
			 </li>
			 <li>Ubunutu Mate OS: 
		i2cdetect -y 1 command shows "68" for real-time clock. This means that drivers were not installed ("uu" should be shown instead).
		It also means if Raspberry Pi has no access to internet, it would not show proper time when executing i2c files.</li>

	<li>As of today (10/11/2016) We are following the Project Schedule and achieved some of the tasks before the due date.<br>
	Components purchasing and their assembly were all done ahead of time given on the schedule. </li>
	<li>Current objectives are (according to the approved proposal) PCB fabrication and Group Placard.
	PCB is soldered already and checked on any malfunctioning in the Prototype Lab. Group Placard in process
	and will be finished on time.</li>	
	<li>Problems/Solutions and Opportunities/Modofications</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Problem:</b> During PCB assembly, I have accidentally soldered all 3 transistors together which would cause the board
			to short circuit and cause malfunction in the future. One of the routes was not working properly <br>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Used desoldering pump to remove solder from transistors and connected bridges with the wire</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Financial Updates:</b> All of the components were met with planned financial needs. No extra coponents were purchased</li>

    <li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
	<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
	<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a

	<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login at: <a
