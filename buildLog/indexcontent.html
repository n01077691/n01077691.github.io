		<H3>Introduction</H3>
		<p>The Software Controlled Drone project allows its' users to control quadcopter (Syma x12) using Arduino with nRF24L01 radio.
		The project is currently unfinished due to unsuccessful binding process.

		<p>Step 1: Purchase the required parts</p>
		<p>Step 2: Connect the nRF24L01 Transceiver to the Arduino</p>
		<p>This is the pin set up from the Arduino to the nRF24L01 Transceiver:</p>
		<p>5v -> VCC <br> GND -> GND <br> D8 -> IRQ <br> D9 -> CE <br> D10 -> CSN
		<br>D11 -> MOSI <br> D12 -> MISO <br> D13 -> SCK <br> Once the circuit has been built, it should look like this: </p>

		<p>Once the circuit has been built, plug the Arduino into the PC and open the Arduino IDE. Import the library into
		the Arduino IDE by going to Sketch->Include Library->Add .ZIP Library. Once the library has been added into the IDE,
		copy the code from <a href="https://libs1.github.io/Documents/arduinoled.ino">here</a>. Once the code is copied, upload it
		by clicking the arrow icon on the top left of the IDE. When it has finished uploading, open the serial monitor by going to
		Tools->Serial Monitor. You are now able to communicate with another transceiver.<br>NOTE: enable for two transceivers to
		communicate with each other, one user will have to have a radioNumber = 0 and another user to have a radioNumber = 1.
		This is changed inside the arduino code.</p>
