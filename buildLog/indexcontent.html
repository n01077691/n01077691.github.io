		The Software Controlled Drone project allows its' users to control quadcopter (Syma x12) using Arduino with nRF24L01 radio.
		The project is currently unfinished due to unsuccessful binding process.

		<p>Step 1: Be sure you have the required parts</p>
		<p>Step 2: Connect the nRF24L01 Transceiver to the Arduino using <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf24l01-transceiver-hookup-guide?_ga=1.24097530.1370475674.1481041091">Hook Up Guide</a></p>
		<p>Step 3: <a href="https://n01077691.github.io/Documentation/RF24.zip">Get</a> the RF24 library with basic examples</p>
	</SECTION>
	
	<SECTION ID="power_up">
		<H3>Power Up</H3>
		<p>Start your Arduino IDE right after the circuit is built. Import the library into
		the Arduino IDE (Sketch->Include Library->Add .ZIP Library -> Select RF24.zip). Once the library has been added into the IDE,
		get the code from <a href="https://n01077691.github.io/Documentation/arduino_open_house.ino">repository</a>.
			
		<b>To establish communication between two transceivers one user will have to set <i>radioNumber = 0</i> and another user has to change to <i>radioNumber = 1.</i></b>
		
		Once the code is compiled, upload it by clicking the arrow icon on the top left of the IDE. Next, check for any 
		compilation errors and open the serial monitor
		(Tools->Serial Monitor). You will now be able to communicate with another sparkFun transceiver.<br>
		Be sure that LED of the Sender goes RED when transceiving times out and GREEN when data is successfully transmitted. LED of
		the receiver will be always GREEN, since it is always trying to receive any data. On the Serial Monitor you should be able to
		see all details about packets sent.<br>
			
		</p>
		<p>NOTE: Since the binding is not yet established, future code examples and documentation will be posted here and be updated
		weekly or bi-weekly.</p>
